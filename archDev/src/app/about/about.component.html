    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      I was born and army brat and with a servants attitude. As soon as I could I joined the US Army Infantry
      and received several medals to include a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_Star_Medal">
      Bronze Star with Valor</a> and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purple_Heart"> Purple Heart</a>
      during my service. On my last deployment to Ramadi, Iraq I was injured and subsequently honorably separated
      from service.</p>
    <p>
      I used what I had learned in the service and attended college to become a paramedic. While continuing to serve my community
      I was asked to maintain the current website for the union I belonged to as well as build another website for a
      community event. I had always had an interest in development but after doing this I knew this would be my future.
      It started becoming increasingly difficult to preform my duties with my previous injuries so I decided I would
      follow my interest and become a developer.

    <p>
      I put in my notice, sold my house and moved my family to Ohio to attend <a href="https://www.techelevator.com/">
      Tech Elevator</a> and start my future. I completed the Tech Elevator boot camp in Aug 2018. Since then I have been
      doing volunteer work on an app for the <a href="https://www.huejackson.org/"> Hue Jackson Foundation</a> in
      partnership with <a href="https://www.ifusesolutions.net/">iFuse Solutions</a>. Now it is time for me to get a job
      and learn even more.
