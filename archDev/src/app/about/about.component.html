    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      I was born an army brat and with a servants attitude. As soon as I could I joined the US Army Infantry.
      During my last deployment I was injured and subsequently honorably separated from service earning several medals to
      include a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_Star_Medal"> Bronze Star with Valor</a> and
      a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purple_Heart"> Purple Heart</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I used what I had learned in the service and took it a step further to become a paramedic. While serving my community
      I was asked to maintain the current website for the union I belonged to, as well as build another website for a
      community event. I had always had an interest in development but after doing this I knew it would be my future.
      Following my interests to become a developer became my primary focus.
    </p>
    <p>
      I put in my notice, sold my house, and moved my family to Ohio to attend
      <a href="https://www.techelevator.com/">Tech Elevator</a> and start my future. I completed the Tech
      Elevator bootcamp in August 2018. Since then, I have continued learning new languages and technologies.
      I also did volunteer work on an app for the<a href="https://www.huejackson.org/"> Hue Jackson Foundation</a>
      in partnership with a company called <a href="https://www.ifusesolutions.net/">iFuse Solutions</a>. I really 
      enjoyed working on this app but I have bills to pay so into the fray it was.
    </p>
    <p>I got my first job as a junior developer at IntelliCog. I was fortunate enough to be on a great team that was truly 
      amazing to work with. I spent my time there making data visualizations with chart.js and D3.js. When I wasn't doing 
      that I was creating / updating APIs on AWS. This let me learn how to use Lambda, Cloud Formation, API Gateway, Cognito, 
      S3 (I could keep going) to create the backend to our web app. Unfortunately, my team was laid off. I have nothing but respect 
      for IntelliCog and the team I worked with. Now it is on to my next adventure.</p>
